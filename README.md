# Project Title

California's healthcare quality change between different presidencies in 2016 vs 2020

## Research Questions

- How does the change in voting patterns (2016 vs. 2020) across California counties correlate with changes in hospital readmission rates, and does this suggest the impact of federal healthcare policies under different presidencies?
- Are there significant differences in readmission rates between counties that consistently voted for one party in both 2016 and 2020, compared to counties that switched parties, and what factors might explain these differences?
- How do readmission rates differ between Republican-leaning ("red") and Democrat-leaning ("blue") counties in California in 2016 vs. 2020? (Using ‘mean()’ as the aggregator to represent the average level of readmission rates)
